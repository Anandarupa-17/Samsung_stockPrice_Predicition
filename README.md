# LSTM Stock Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the closing prices of Samsung Electronics stock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock price data, including features such as opening price, high price, low price, adjusted close price, and trading volume.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical trading data for Samsung Electronics stock. The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the trading session.
Open: The opening price of the stock at the beginning of the trading session.
High: The highest price reached by the stock during the trading session.
Low: The lowest price reached by the stock during the trading session.
Close: The closing price of the stock at the end of the trading session (target label).
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, accounting for any corporate actions or adjustments affecting the stock price.
Volume: The total number of shares traded during the trading session.
Model
The LSTM model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of an LSTM layer followed by one or more dense layers. The input features are fed into the model to predict the closing price of the stock.

# Preprocessing
Before training the LSTM model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including:

Handling missing data: Any missing values in the dataset are filled or removed as appropriate.
Feature selection: Only relevant features (e.g., Open, High, Low, Adj Close, Volume) are used for training the model.
Feature scaling: The input features are scaled to a suitable range to facilitate model training.
Sequence creation: The dataset is converted into sequences of input features and corresponding target labels to train the LSTM model.
Training
The LSTM model is trained using historical stock price data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The model is trained using backpropagation and optimized using the Adam optimizer.

# Evaluation
The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing set. Additionally, visualizations such as plots of actual vs. predicted stock prices may be generated to assess the model's performance visually.

# Usage
To use the LSTM model for stock price prediction:

1. Install the required dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, etc.).
2. Load the historical stock price data.
3. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
4. Train the LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using suitable metrics.
6. Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
